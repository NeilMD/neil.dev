            We opted for storing JWT tokens in the Authorization header and

          Another challenge was determining the right level of granularity for
          role-based access. Since the application has relatively simple
          functionality,{" "}
          <span className="text-black text-md italic font-light">
            we opted for route-level protection. This simplified implementation,
            but we acknowledged the trade-off of not having more granular
            control over specific actions (e.g., read, write, delete) within a
            route.{" "}
          </span>
          For now, this structure meets the projectâ€™s needs, but future
          iterations might require more detailed access control mechanisms.

          Implementing secure token management to prevent CSRF and XSS attacks

            Storing refresh tokens in HttpOnly cookies provided additional
            security but added complexity to the token refresh process.{" "}
          </span>
          We had to ensure that the token refresh process was smooth and
          seamless for the user to avoid session interruptions.{" "}

        <p className="text-zinc-400 mb-2">
          Ultimately, these challenges led us to make design choices that
          emphasized security while maintaining a positive user experience. In
          future projects, we may consider more granular role-based permissions
          and explore further enhancements to session management.
