            The project used a proprietary framework built on top of a Japanese
            software providerâ€™s platform, with no community support or online
            resources available.

          Since the company created its own framework, external solutions or
          discussions were non-existent, making troubleshooting particularly
          difficult. Much of the documentation was in Japanese, which added to
          the complexity. The only available support was the official channel,
          and confidentiality restrictions prohibited public inquiries.
