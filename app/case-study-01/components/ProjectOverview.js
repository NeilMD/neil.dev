          As part of my role, I contributed to multiple projects, with the most
          significant being the Cloud Integration initiative for a web
          application used by a Japanese bank to manage syndicated loansâ€”loans
          provided by a group of lenders to a single borrower. The system was
          built on a proprietary tech stack from a Japanese enterprise software
          provider, featuring a unique architecture that combined custom
          frameworks using a mix of Java and JavaScript.
